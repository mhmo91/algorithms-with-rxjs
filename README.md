# What this repo is about

writing solutions for common algorithms and data structure challenges with rxjs

# Motivation

Computations can only get faster with concurrency, asynchronous programming is the future of engineering. However it's not easy to think async.
Rxjs is the Javascript implementation of the observer Pattern.

RxJs is:

    Functional
    Avoid intricate stateful programs, using clean input/output functions over observable streams.

    Less is more
    ReactiveX's operators often reduce what was once an elaborate challenge into a few lines of code.

    Async error handling
    Traditional try/catch is powerless for errors in asynchronous computations, but ReactiveX is equipped with proper mechanisms for handling errors.

    Concurrency made easy
    Observables and Schedulers in ReactiveX allow the programmer to abstract away low-level threading, synchronization, and concurrency issues.

# Why you should contribute

because this is a unique project where you can practice and share with the open source community what can be done with the observer pattern

this is nodejs environment, use node command line to excute the files

# How to excute a solution

`npm i`

`npm start <location to file>`

example
`npm start src/arrays/next-permutation.ts `
